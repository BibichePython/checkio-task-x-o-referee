    Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players
    (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
    The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

    But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results. You are given a result of a
    game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X"
    if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D."
