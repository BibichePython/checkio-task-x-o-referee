        You need to check all horizontals, verticals and diagonals.
        If any of them contains three equal symbols (exclude "."), then this symbol won.

        It's easy to check horizontals:
            <pre class="brush: python">
for row in field:
    if row[0] == row[1] == row[2] and row[0] != ".":
        bla bla
        </pre>

        To check verticals you can rotate a matrix with this trick:
        <pre class="brush: python">
rotated_field = zip(*field)</pre>

        And diagonals you can check with hard-code (field[0][0]&nbsp;==&nbsp;field[1][1]&nbsp;==&nbsp;...).
